- Initial workspace created


## 2025-12-21

Created comprehensive analysis document and research diary documenting complete SDK architecture, WebRTC implementation, audio pipeline, and all components


## 2025-12-21

Created comprehensive SDK configuration comparison and hardware analysis document. Compared sdkconfig.defaults across three ESP32-S3 projects (echo-base, ATOMS3R-CAM-M12, M5Cardputer), analyzed 9 key configuration differences, and documented hardware specifications for each platform including memory architecture, peripherals, and optimization strategies.

Enhanced analysis document with full paragraphs, improved readability, and comprehensive links to resources, tutorials, and examples. Added narrative flow throughout the document while maintaining structured content.


## 2025-12-21

Enhanced architecture analysis document with full paragraphs, improved narrative flow, and comprehensive links to resources, tutorials, RFCs, and examples. Added contextual explanations throughout while maintaining structured technical content.


## 2025-12-21

Created comprehensive technical writing guidelines document capturing the writing approach used in architecture analysis documents. Guidelines cover narrative context, structured content balance, resource linking, and practical considerations.


## 2025-12-21

Enhanced analysis document with improved narrative flow per technical writing guidelines. Added contextual introductions to all major sections, improved explanations of 'why' behind technical decisions, added links to ESP-IDF documentation, enhanced transitions between sections, and improved conclusion with actionable takeaways. Document now better balances structured technical content with narrative explanations.
