### 3.1 GPIO Interface

| LCD Signal | Pico GPIO | Function | Schematic Trace |

| MOSI | GP11 | SPI0\_TX | C11→LCD Pin 8 |

## 4\. Keypad Interface (Reverse Engineered)

### 4.1 I2C Connection

Through extensive reverse engineering, we've determined the keyboard is controlled by an I2C peripheral:

| Interface Parameter | Value | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| I2C Bus | I2C1 | Secondary I2C bus on the Pico |
| SDA Pin | GP6 | Serial Data Line |
| SCL Pin | GP7 | Serial Clock Line |
| I2C Address | 0x1F | 7-bit addressing scheme |
| Clock Frequency | 100 kHz | Standard I2C mode |
| Pull-up Resistors | 4.7kΩ | On both SDA and SCL lines |

### 4.2 Communication Protocol

The protocol follows a custom I2C implementation:

1. **Command Phase**:
	- Master (Pico) writes command byte 0x09 to address 0x1F
		- This command initiates a keyboard status read
2. **Response Phase**:
	- Master (Pico) reads 2 bytes from the keyboard controller
		- Response format is a 16-bit status word:
		- For standard keys: High byte (MSB) contains event type, Low byte (LSB) contains key code
				- For Enter key: Type is 0x0A in LSB, code is 0x01 or 0x03 in MSB
		- Status word of 0 indicates no key event
3. **Event Types**:
	- 0x01: Key press event
		- 0x02: Key repeat event
		- 0x03: Key release event
		- 0x0A: Special event type (used with Enter key)
4. **Special Control Codes**:
	- 0xA502: Control key pressed
		- 0xA503: Control key released
		- 0x7E02: Alternative Control key pressed
		- 0x7E03: Alternative Control key released

### 4.3 Keycode Mapping Table

Through our reverse engineering, we've mapped these key codes:

| Key Code (Hex) | Mapped Function | Physical Button |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0xB1 | ESC (27) | Escape |
| 0x81-0x89 | F1-F9 | Function 1-9 |
| 0x90 | F10 | Function 10 |
| 0xB5 | UP (128) | Up Arrow |
| 0xB6 | DOWN (130) | Down Arrow |
| 0xB7 | RIGHT (129) | Right Arrow |
| 0xB4 | LEFT (131) | Left Arrow |
| 0xD0 | BreakKey (3) | Break |
| 0xD1 | INSERT (132) | Insert |
| 0xD2 | HOME (134) | Home |
| 0xD5 | END (135) | End |
| 0xD6 | PUP (136) | Page Up |
| 0xD7 | PDOWN (137) | Page Down |
| 0x01/0x03\* | ENTER (13) | Enter/Return |
| 0x5A | ENTER (13) | Alternative Enter |
| 0x0D | ENTER (13) | CR code |

\*Note: Enter key generates two sequential codes (0x010A followed by 0x030A)

### 4.4 Implementation Notes

- The keyboard controller internally scans a physical key matrix
- It debounces key presses in hardware before sending status
- For Control+letter combinations, the controller sets the `ctrlheld` flag internally
- When Control is active, lowercase letter key codes (a-z) are modified: `key_code - 'a' + 1` (ASCII control codes)
- Different interpretation for key event type and key code bytes depending on key type:
	- Standard keys: event type in MSB, key code in LSB
		- Enter key: special coding with type 0x0A in LSB
		- Control keys: fixed 16-bit values for press/release events

### 4.5 Electrical Characteristics

- I2C Bus Logic Level: 3.3V
- Pull-up Configuration: 4.7kΩ pull-ups on both SDA and SCL lines
- Recommended polling rate: 50Hz
- Timing Considerations: 1ms delay required between command write and response read
