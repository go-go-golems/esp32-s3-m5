# Analyze M5Cardputer demo UI (UserDemo + ADV)

## Overview

Analyze how the UI systems in `M5Cardputer-UserDemo` and `M5Cardputer-UserDemo-ADV` are structured: widget model, animation model, event/callback model, scene (app) lifecycle, and how those abstractions map to ESP-IDF/FreeRTOS primitives.

Primary deliverables are the “textbook” design doc and the running analysis diary.
