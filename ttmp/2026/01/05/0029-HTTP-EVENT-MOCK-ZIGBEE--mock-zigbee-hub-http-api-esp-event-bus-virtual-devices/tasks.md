- [ ] Decide event-stream transport (SSE vs WS) and backpressure strategy
- [ ] Plan persistence: device registry in-memory + NVS snapshot/debounce
- [ ] Implement firmware skeleton (WiFi connect, http server, app event loop)
- [ ] Implement device_sim (timers) + registry + scenes + SSE/WS event stream
